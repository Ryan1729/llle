## TODO

* Add a visible cursor, realizing that I will want to have more that one later
  * fix bug where the cursor can go past where it is supposed to.
   * Specifically, the second last line seems to have extra characters on it, proportional to the characters on the last line
* Try to implement a version of character ranges that uses the range operator (..)
