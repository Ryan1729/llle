## TODO

* handle line feed characters properly 
  * this implies disallowing moving the cursor below the line.

* fix cursor being visible through status line (!?)

* find or write `less` like program that allows toggling between full view of stdout, only those lines that match a multiline regex or whatever and only those that don't.
  * display input logs`[libs\editor\./src/editor.rs:148] input` etc
